## :rocket: About the project

This is a basic clone of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>.
It includes most of the features from the home, profile, and friends pages(Including all the portals and poppers, used for interacting with elements).

Interface for the most part is recreated one-to-one with the original, fully responsive, and has dark mode.
Components are structured in an Atomic, modular way.

For now the is no auth system, every user is a dummy/random one, and everyone is free to log on to, with a click of a button.
All the(users, chats, photos, posts, comments, reactions, friends, relationships) data on the site, is generated by script not included in the repo.
The script uses <a href="https://fakerjs.dev//">Faker</a>, and <a href="https://loremflickr.com/">LoremFlickr</a>, and uploads all the data.

Data is stored in Firebase, and not designed to scale whatsoever(to reduce document reads). In some parts it results in weirdly structured code.
Users are also indexed on <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> for searching autocomplete.
